# Debian 7 (Wheezy) does NOT have the required libnss version (>= 3.16) for Libreswan.
# This script provides a workaround by installing newer packages from libreswan.org.
# Debian 7 users: Run this script first, before using the VPN setup script.
#
# IMPORTANT: These unofficial packages may not receive security updates compared to
# official Debian packages. They could contain vulnerabilities. Use at your own risk!
